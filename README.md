# Bob Buzzard's Salesforce CLI Samples

## Getting started
Clone the repository and cd into the directory created.
Execute npm install to set up the dependencies.

All the scripts are subcommands executed from the index.js file.

## Export Metadata
Replicates the functionality of the [Force.com CLI](http://force-cli.herokuapp.com/) export subcommand.

Usage: `node index.js export -u <Salesforce CLI username> -d <output directory>`
